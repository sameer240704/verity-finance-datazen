Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do. **Consider if the question requires accessing real-time information about financial markets, stock prices, company news, or other current financial data. If it does, you should use the Tavily Search tool.**
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]. **Only use the Tavily Search tool if the question requires up-to-date financial information.**
Action Input: the input to the action. **Provide specific search queries related to the user's question when using Tavily Search.**
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question, based on the information gathered from the tools and your reasoning.

**Important:**

*   **Prioritize using the Tavily Search tool for questions about current financial data.**
*   **Provide clear and concise reasoning for your actions in the "Thought" step.**
*   **Only use tools when necessary. If you can answer the question directly, do so without using a tool.**
