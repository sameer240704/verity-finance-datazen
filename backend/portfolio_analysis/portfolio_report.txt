## Portfolio Report and Market Analysis

### Portfolio Summary

This portfolio is heavily weighted in TCS.NS (TCS) and contains a mix of US tech stocks and a government bond.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Overall Asset Allocation:** The portfolio is heavily weighted towards stocks (approximately 85%), with a significant portion in a single stock (TCS.NS). Bonds represent the remaining 15%. This indicates a moderately aggressive risk profile, though the large position in TCS could concentrate risk.

*   **Stock Performance:**
    *   **AAPL (Apple):**  Showing positive unrealized gains.  Recent quarterly income statements show consistent revenue and strong net profit margins, generally above 25%. The most recent quarter (2025-12-28) shows a significant jump in revenue and net income.
    *   **NVDA (NVIDIA):**  Experiencing significant unrealized losses.  However, NVIDIA's recent quarterly income statements reveal substantial growth in revenue and net profit margins. The net profit margin has consistently stayed above 50% in the last few quarters.
    *   **AMZN (Amazon):**  Also showing significant unrealized losses. Amazon's net profit margins are lower than Apple's and Nvidia's, but they have been improving over the last few quarters.
    *   **TCS.NS (TCS):**  Generating substantial unrealized gains and provides a dividend yield of 2.8%.  This is a strong performer in the portfolio, but its outsized weight creates concentration risk.

*   **Bond Performance:** The Government bond has a coupon rate of 6.5% and a yield to maturity of 13%.  This indicates that the bond is trading at a discount to its face value. The provided articles suggest uncertainty in the bond market due to factors like potential policy changes and concerns about long-term government debt.

*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** AAPL and TCS.NS provide dividend income, while NVDA and AMZN offer minimal or no yield.
    *   **Unrealized Gains/Losses:**  The portfolio is showing mixed results, with significant gains in AAPL and TCS.NS, offset by losses in NVDA and AMZN.
    *   **Weightage:**  The portfolio is heavily weighted towards TCS.NS (61.86%) and AMZN (14.29%). AAPL and the Government bond have moderate weightages, while NVDA has a very small weightage.

*   **WITH**
